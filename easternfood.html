    	<h2>1. Fatteh Eggplant</h2>
    	<img src="images/jordan.webp" alt="Jordan">
    	<p>Fatteh literally means “crumble” in arabic. It has many different variations made with various ingredients. This specific recipe is an eggplant based dish, and is commonly made in the Levant. Some other familiar names of this dish are fattet makdous, fatteh betanjan (meaning eggplant), etc.. This dish is made of many different layers, and most can be prepared ahead of time. The yogurt layer can be placed back in the fridge; the garnishes can be put away to the side; but the eggplant in tomato sauce and ground beef are best served hot.</p>

    	<img src="images/syria.png" alt="Syria">
    	<p>This dish is also known as Kibbeh with chard. Kibbeh is frequently eaten in the Levant and is a national dish in Syria and Lebanon. It is typically made by pounding bulgur wheat and meat until it turns into a paste, and then forming it into balls. These balls are filled with pine nuts, walnuts, meat, and spices. After the dough forms around the filling, the balls are either fried or baked. There are many variations to the dish, and this recipe is an example of one. It is a vegetarian form of Kibbeh, with chard as a filling and a red pepper paste on top.</p>

    	<h2>3. Falafel</h2>
    	<img src="images/syria.png" alt="Syria">
    	<p>Falafel is another dish that has different versions. It is a common Arabic street food. There are two main types of falafel: one from the Levant made from chickpeas, and the other from Egypt made from fava beans. In Egypt, it’s called ta’ameya. Although falafel and ta’ameya are both delicious, they vary in density, texture, and flavor. The recipe I share with you today is a traditional “syrian” falafel.</p>
